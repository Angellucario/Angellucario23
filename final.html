            Hello Everyone! Here is my final projectâ€”I decided to create Tetris. This game took a considerable amount of time to develop due to its complexity. 
            Tetris has always been a favorite of mine and is a classic game. In developing it, I utilized all the skills I've acquired and applied them to this project.
             While I couldn't incorporate every feature of the original Tetris, I did my best to closely replicate its core aspects. I hope you enjoy it!

    <h1><u>How To Play</u></h1>
    <p>In Tetris, your goal is to score points by making complete horizontal lines with different shaped blocks that fall from the top of the screen. You start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
     Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the blocks side to side. Press the down arrow key to make the blocks fall faster. 
    When you fill up a whole line with blocks, it disappears and you get points. The game keeps going with more blocks falling faster until there's no more room for new blocks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right key moves block Left</li>
        <li>Left key moves block Left</li>
        <li>Down key makes blocks move down quicker</li>
        <li>Make a row and get 100 point</li>
        <li>Once a block touches the top, you lose!</li>
    </ul>
